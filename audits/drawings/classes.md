# The PHB classes — the drawing (measured 2026-09-28)

> **What this is:** the verdict on every PHB class and subclass feature, class by class with its subclasses
> under it (the user's order, 2026-09-28), read against the evidence in [../classes/](../classes/) and the
> tables in `scripts/decide/registry.js`. The class is **every PHB class and subclass feature**
> ([[examples-are-classes]]): 352 rows in `dnd-players-handbook.classes` (12 classes, 48 subclasses) plus
> the 67 options nothing grants ([../options.md](../options.md)). The precedent row is named for every
> verdict, per [[land-by-mechanism-not-family]]; a UI-shaped item is ruled off a prototype before a line.
>
> **Verdicts:** NATIVE — the pack or the platform does it, nothing owed · ROW — a row in a table that
> exists · ROW+VOCAB — a row plus a facet the table does not have yet · KIND — a mechanism the module
> lacks · OUT — no combat moment the module judges (DESIGN §4), or a ruling. The slice order is not
> decided here — the user sets it once the DM and Monster Manual drawings land.

## What the twelve classes share — the vocabulary the drawing creates

The same dozen shapes recur across every class; the count is how many customers each has in the PHB
classes alone. **A shape with three or more customers is built once, as a table; a one-customer shape
waits for its player.**

| Shape | Customers | Precedent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **The reroll kind** (SWEEP §3 item 5: reroll a failed save or a missed attack, with or without a bonus) | Indomitable, Fanatical Focus, Disciplined Survivor, Living Legend, Countercharm (an ally's save), Dark One's Own Luck (add a d10 after), Homing Strikes (add a die after a miss), Peerless Skill | `D20_FOLDS` (`precision`, `bardic`, `heroic`, `succeed`): a `reroll` kind beside them |
| **The hit menu's next groups** (RULINGS *The hit menu*) | Brutal Strike (+ the forgo-Advantage gate box), Stunning Strike, Open Hand Technique, Psionic Strike + Telekinetic Thrust, Hand of Harm (+ Physician's Touch), Elemental Attunement's push/pull, Hurl Through Hell, Eldritch Smite (a NEW cost kind: a spell slot) | `HIT_OPTIONS` / `HIT_GROUPS`; cost kinds today: sneak dice, a Focus Point, a Superiority Die, a use |

| **A grant at the bearer's turn start** (temp HP, a heal) | Vitality of the Tree, Survivor's heal, Elder Champion's heal, Heroic Warrior's inspiration, Circle Forms' temp HP (on the shape-shift); Heroism (SWEEP §7) | `CLOCK_RIDERS` reads `turnStart` for damage; a `grant` facet (heal / tempHP / a chip) is the vocabulary |
| **A flat bonus to one spell damage roll** | Empowered Evocation, Elemental Affinity, Radiant Soul, Potent Spellcasting ×2 (measure: the pack says the bonus "is not" automatic) | none — one table `SPELL_DAMAGE_BONUS` on the damage-roll seam the riders use |
| **Emanation rows** | Aura of Devotion, Holy Nimbus (pulse + saves), Elder Champion (saves), Corona of Light (saves), Rage of the Wilds' Wolf, Branches of the Tree (alert + save), Wrath of the Sea (a chosen pulse), Avenging Angel (enter), Oceanic Gift (a bearer facet) | `EMANATIONS` feature rows; `pulse`, `alert`, `trigger` exist |
| **The kill moment, both sides** | victim: Relentless Rage (a rising-DC save facet), Undying Sentinel, Gift of the Protectors · killer: Dark One's Blessing | `DROP_TO_ONE` (Relentless Endurance, Death Ward); Slice B owns the rest |

| **A damage-absorbing pool, automatic** | Arcane Ward (+ Projected Ward as its reaction), Bastion of Law | none — the `preApplyDamage` seam `DROP_TO_ONE` sits on; R1: no choice, no popup |
| **Advantage cancelled against the bearer** | Elusive, Trance of Order | `EFFECT_BENDS`: a `noAdvantage` facet the gate reads |
| **A floor under the d20** ("treat 9 or lower as 10") | Trance of Order, Starry Form's Dragon (Concentration saves) | the dice changers' floor (Elemental Adept) is on damage dice; a `floor` D20 fold is the vocabulary |

| **Arcane Ward** (Abjurer) | uses, text | ROW+VOCAB → the damage-absorbing pool at `preApplyDamage`, automatic (R1: the ward has no choice), refilled by Abjuration casts — the first customer of the shape |

| **Spell Resistance** (Abjurer) | text | ROW+VOCAB → `EFFECT_BENDS` `saves` Advantage with a `vsSpells` judge (the demand knows its source is a spell); the resistance NATIVE |

| **Potent Cantrip** (Evoker) | text | ROW+VOCAB → the verdict's half rule per CASTER feature (Evasion's mirror: a cantrip's successful save still takes half) |
| **Sculpt Spells** (Evoker) | text | ROW → Careful Spell's machine (`METAMAGIC`'s area ask) as a feature row: 1 + the slot level chosen creatures succeed and take nothing |
| **Empowered Evocation** (Evoker) | dmg | ROW → `SPELL_DAMAGE_BONUS` (+Int to one damage roll of an Evocation) |
| **Overchannel** (Evoker) | dmg, uses | ROW+VOCAB → the dice changers' `max` (Empowered's popup) + a self-damage clock on the second use per rest — waits for a customer |

| **Lunging Attack** (maneuver) | dmg | ROW → `USE_CHIPS` (Dash, then the die on a melee hit this turn) |
| **Evasive Footwork** (maneuver) | effect | measure → the die as AC until the turn ends — NATIVE if the pack's effect rolls it |
| **Bait and Switch** (maneuver) | 12 effects | NATIVE (the swap is movement; the AC bonus an effect) |

**NATIVE:** Agonizing Blast, Eldritch Spear, Devil's Sight, Fiendish Vigor, Thirsting Blade, Devouring Blade, Witch Sight, Pact of the Blade / Chain / Tome, the ten metamagic options, the on-hit and fold maneuvers (rows), Rally, Ambush, Tactical Assessment, Commanding Presence.

## The tally, by class

| Class | Rows in a table that exists | Rows needing a facet | Waits for a kind | UI-shaped (prototype first) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Barbarian | 6 | 6 | Fanatical Focus | Brutal Strike's gate box |
| Bard | 8 | 1 | Countercharm, Peerless Skill | — |
| Cleric | 6 | 2 | — | — |
| Druid | 4 | 2 | — | — |
| Fighter | 8 | 4 | Indomitable | — |
| Monk | 10 | 1 | Disciplined Survivor | — |
| Paladin | 9 | 2 | Living Legend | Inspiring Smite |
| Ranger | 6 | 4 | — | — |
| Rogue | 4 | 1 | Homing Strikes | — |
| Sorcerer | 5 | 3 | — | Wild Magic Surge |
| Warlock | 4 | 5 | Dark One's Own Luck | — |
| Wizard | 3 | 4 | — | Portent |
| Options | 6 | 1 | — | — |

**The one kind the classes ask for is the reroll kind** (eight customers). Everything else is rows and
facets on tables that exist, and the four prototypes. The order between classes is the user's, set by
the next party (BACKLOG *The long-term order* step 5): this drawing is the map, not the commission.

## Register verdicts (2026-09-29, for Session 0's plan)

> **What this table is:** the hand verdicts the generated register cannot derive — one row per feature the
> defaults get wrong, read by `tools/audit-classes-register.mjs` (a default is MODULE when a table names the
> row, OUT for a spell list, TEXT for a paragraph, else NATIVE). The words: NATIVE · MODULE (a table names it
> today) · **ROW** (a row or a facet on a machine that exists — *Precedent* names the table and the row it
> resembles, per the standing rule) · **TABLE** (a new table, not a kind) · **KIND** (the R4 tripwire moves) ·
> TEXT · OUT · **WAITS** (drawn, held for its first player). *Stage* is the plan's build stage
> ([../plans/session-0-classes.md](../plans/session-0-classes.md)): A1–A7 the level 1–5 band, B1–B5 levels 6–10,
> C1 levels 11–16, D1 levels 17–20, M0 a measurement first (the sandbox, after the release battery) —
> nothing here is built until the user says go. Names are the pack's own.

| Feature | Class — Sub | Verdict | Precedent | Stage | Why not / how |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Rage** | Barbarian | ROW | `TURN_GRANTS` · Regeneration (`match: "feature"`, a turn-END judge) | A1 | the numbers are the pack's; the EARLY END ("neither attacked nor taken damage since your last turn") is a REMINDER at the rager's turn end read off the attack chit and the receipts since its last turn — never an automatic end: nothing records the Bonus Action that keeps it (a bend row) |
| **Danger Sense** | Barbarian | NATIVE | — | — | measured 2026-09-29 (M0): the pack's transferred effect writes `system.abilities.dex.save.roll.mode` +1, the platform rolls the Advantage (Gnomish Cunning's shape); the Incapacitated exception is the table's (the pack's own note: toggle it in the Effects tab) |
| **Brutal Strike** | Barbarian | ROW | `HIT_GROUPS` · Combat Superiority + `HIT_OPTIONS` · Trip Attack; the gate box: `ADVANTAGE_BUYS` · Lucky (its mirror — a FORGO tick) | B3 | UI-shaped, prototype: the forgo-Advantage trade is a tick in the attack dialog beside the Reckless box (before the roll, never after); the hit then offers the Brutal Strike group — Forceful Blow (push, a line), Hamstring Blow (the pack's effect), one pick |
| **Relentless Rage** | Barbarian | ROW | `DROP_TO_ONE` · Undead Fortitude (`save`) + Relentless Endurance (`uses`) | C1 | held at 1 while the Constitution save rolls on the keeper, DC 10 rising by 5 per use (a `dc` counter facet, reset on a rest), `while: raging`; a success heals the level's worth as the pack's heal activity |
| **Persistent Rage** | Barbarian | TABLE | `INITIATIVE_GRANTS` (new; the seam `initiative-swap.js` reads — every combatant rolled) | A6 | regain all Rage uses when Initiative is rolled — a card and the sheet write, no choice (R1); 5 customers across the classes make the table |
| **Improved Brutal Strike** | Barbarian | ROW | `HIT_OPTIONS` · the Brutal Strike group | B3 | Staggering Blow (Disadvantage on the next save — an effect the gate's `saves` facet reads), Sundering Blow (+5 to the next ally's attack — a `USE_CHIPS`-shaped give on the ally) |
| **Improved Brutal Strike (2)** | Barbarian | ROW | `HIT_GROUPS` · `max: 2` (the pick-per-group ruling) | D1 | two different Brutal Strike effects on one hit: the group's `max` |
| **Frenzy** | Barbarian — Path of the Berserker | ROW | `CLOCK_RIDERS` · Divine Fury (`when: oncePerTurn`, `judge: raging`) | A1 | the first hit of the turn while Reckless Attack was used this turn — a `judge: reckless` (the Reckless chip on the attacker) beside `raging` |
| **Rage of the Wilds** | Barbarian — Path of the Wild Heart | ROW | `EFFECT_CHOICES` · Fire Shield (the pick at the use) + `EMANATIONS` · Aura of Protection (`while`) | A1 | Bear / Eagle / Wolf asked at the Rage (the pack's two effects); the Wolf's allies' Advantage on melee attacks against creatures within 5 ft of the rager is a feature ring `while: raging` whose member effect the gate reads |
| **Power of the Wilds** | Barbarian — Path of the Wild Heart | ROW | `EMANATIONS` · Reactive Strike's ring (`quiet`) + `CLOCK_RIDERS` · Hill's Tumble's press | C1 | Lion: a ring whose members' attacks NOT at the rager roll at Disadvantage (`EFFECT_BENDS` on the member effect, `except: source`); Ram: a no-save Prone press on a hit once per turn; Falcon: NATIVE (fly) |
| **Vitality of the Tree** | Barbarian — Path of the World Tree | ROW | `TURN_GRANTS` · Heroism (`grant: temphp`, `while: raging`) | A6 | temp HP = the Rage Damage bonus at the Rage's start and at each turn start while raging; Life-Giving Force (an ally within 10 ft at the turn's end) is the same row `on: turnEnd`, `to: ally` — a pick, so asked |
| **Branches of the Tree** | Barbarian — Path of the World Tree | ROW | `EMANATIONS` · Unnerving Gaze (`alert.on: "turnStart"`, 30 ft) | B5 | a hostile starting its turn within 30 ft while raging raises the reminder; the Reaction's save and the teleport are the activity's, from the sheet |
| **Fanatical Focus** | Barbarian — Path of the Zealot | KIND | `D20_FOLDS` · Heroic Inspiration (a reroll, `replace`) — the `reroll` kind, table `REROLLS` | B1 | a failed save rerolled with the Rage Damage bonus added, once per Rage (`while: raging`, the once a chit keyed to the Rage effect) |
| **Rage of the Gods** | Barbarian — Path of the Zealot | ROW | `INTERRUPT_REDUCTIONS` · Interception (`ally`, `reach: 30`) | C1 | Protective Wings: a Reaction that takes an ally's damage within 30 ft — the guard's shape, the whole amount (`all`), the flight and the resistances the pack's effect |
| **Indomitable Might** | Barbarian | OUT | — | — | a check floor — no check gate carries a floor, and the user's rule keeps checks out |
| **Primal Champion** | Barbarian | OUT | — | — | ability scores — the sheet's |
| **Instinctive Pounce** | Barbarian | OUT | — | — | movement (DESIGN §4) |
| **Primal Knowledge** | Barbarian | OUT | — | — | skills — the sheet's |
| **Travel Along the Tree** | Barbarian — Path of the World Tree | OUT | — | — | a teleport — movement (DESIGN §4) |

| **Nature Speaker** | Barbarian — Path of the Wild Heart | OUT | — | — | an out-of-combat cast |
| **Weapon Mastery** | Barbarian | NATIVE | — | — | the mastery machine (`mastery.js`) reads the weapon's own property |
| **Countercharm** | Bard | KIND | the `reroll` kind (Fanatical Focus) with `ally: 30` (Protection's guard shape, on the save side) | B1 | an ALLY's failed save against Charmed or Frightened within 30 ft: the bard's Reaction, the reroll with Advantage — offered on the save withhold (Guarded Mind's seam), the bard the answerer |
| **Superior Inspiration** | Bard | TABLE | `INITIATIVE_GRANTS` · Persistent Rage | D1 | regain uses to two when Initiative is rolled — a sheet write and a card |
| **Font of Inspiration** | Bard | OUT | — | — | rest recovery and a slot-for-a-use trade — the sheet's |
| **Expertise** | Bard | OUT | — | — | a proficiency |
| **Magical Secrets** | Bard | OUT | — | — | spell selection |

| **Peerless Skill** | Bard — College of Lore | ROW | `D20_FOLDS` · Tactical Mind (`tactical`: an item's uses) with `tests: [attack, check]` | C1 | the bard's OWN failed check or attack roll: the Bardic die added, paid from Bardic Inspiration's uses — the `tactical` spend widened by a `tests` facet |
| **Combat Inspiration** | Bard — College of Valor | ROW | `D20_FOLDS` · Inspired (`bardic`) + `CLOCK_RIDERS` (a damage die from a chip) + `INTERRUPT_ROLLS` · Shield's `ac` shape | A1 | the attack half IS the `bardic` fold today (an Inspired creature's attack); the damage half a ticked die on the offer paid from the Inspired effect; the AC half an `ac` interrupt (+die) paid from the holder's own Inspired effect — the hold's popup to the HOLDER |
| **Battle Magic** | Bard — College of Valor | ROW | `BONUS_SWINGS` · Pole Strike (`when: "cast"`) | C1 | after an action-cast, Hew's reminder: one weapon attack as a Bonus Action — the swing from the sheet |
| **Martial Training** | Bard — College of Valor | OUT | — | — | proficiencies; the spellcasting focus is the sheet's |
| **Inspiring Movement** | Bard — College of Dance | ROW | `EMANATIONS` · Reactive Strike (`alert`, 5 ft) with `alert.on: "turnEnd"` | B5 | an ENEMY ending its turn within 5 ft raises the reminder (a use of Bardic Inspiration, the Reaction); the move is the player's — `turnEnd` joins the alert vocabulary |
| **Tandem Footwork** | Bard — College of Dance | TABLE | `INITIATIVE_GRANTS` · Persistent Rage, `to: "allies"` (Musician's give) | B4 | at Initiative, a use of Bardic Inspiration gives the die to allies within 30 ft (the bard too) — the numbers re-set as Ambush's fold re-sets a combatant's |
| **Leading Evasion** | Bard — College of Dance | ROW | `EVASIONS` · Evasion (`reach: 5`) | C1 | allies within 5 ft share the bard's Evasion verdict — a `reach` facet the consequences pass reads off the map (R1) |

| **Beguiling Magic** | Bard — College of Glamour | NATIVE | — | — | the pack: a save, Charmed / Frightened |

| **Mantle of Majesty** | Bard — College of Glamour | ROW | `EFFECT_BENDS` · Trance (`saves.succeeds`) mirrored: `saves.fails` | B2 | while Mantle of Majesty stands, a creature CHARMED BY THE BARD fails Command's save — a `fails` facet keyed to the spell and the Charmed's provenance (the module's stamp) |
| **Unbreakable Majesty** | Bard — College of Glamour | ROW | `DUPLICATES` · Reflective Carapace (`match: "feature"`, a save for the die) | C1 | after a HIT stands, the attacker's Charisma save (the pack's activity); a failure turns the hit into a miss (`absorbed`), and the row is spent for that attacker's turn — NOT Sanctuary's before-the-roll shape (the 2024 text puts the save after the hit) |
| **Bonus Proficiencies** | Bard — College of Lore | OUT | — | — | proficiencies |

| **Blessed Healer** | Cleric — Life Domain | ROW | `HEAL_REROLLS` · Disciple of Life — a `self: "2 + @slot"` facet | B4 | after a slot-cast healing spell aimed at another creature lands, the cleric regains 2 + the slot level, its own receipt on the cast card |

| **Invoke Duplicity** | Cleric — Trickery Domain | MODULE | `EFFECT_BENDS` · Invoke Duplicity | — | the bend row exists; the illusion's position is the table's |
| **Improved Duplicity** | Cleric — Trickery Domain | ROW | `EFFECT_BENDS` · Invoke Duplicity (`allies: true`) | D1 | Shared Distraction: the bend serves allies too; the heal when the illusion ends is OUT (the illusion is not a token the module reads) |

| **Searing Vengeance** | Warlock — Celestial Patron | ROW | `DROP_TO_ONE` · Relentless Endurance (`ask`) at the DEATH SAVE (`dnd5e.rollDeathSave`, the vetoable hook) with `ally: 60` | C1 | when the warlock or an ally within 60 ft is about to roll a Death Saving Throw: an OFFER — half the maximum HP back, the burst's radiant damage and Blinded on enemies within 30 ft (the pack's activity at the corpse's position: Death Throes' shape); once per Long Rest |
| **Dark One's Blessing** | Warlock — Fiend Patron | ROW | `HEAL_ON_HIT` · Vampiric Touch (`on: "kill"`, `temphp`) | A1 | when a creature the warlock damaged drops to 0 (the damage's dealing card names the warlock — the rebukes' seam), Cha + level temp HP land on the warlock with a receipt, no choice (R1); a drop the module cannot read (a sheet edit) gives nothing — a bend row |
| **Dark One's Own Luck** | Warlock — Fiend Patron | ROW | `D20_FOLDS` · Tactical Mind (`tactical`: uses through the feature's activity) with `tests: [check, save]` | B4 | a d10 added to a check or save after the roll, the feature's uses paid — the `tactical` spend widened by a `tests` facet; offered on the withhold for a demanded save, in the rescue window for a check |

| **Create Thrall** | Warlock — Great Old One Patron | ROW | `CLOCK_RIDERS` · Bestial Fury's companion row | C1 | a summon's free cast (NATIVE); measured 2026-09-29 (M0): the extra psychic is a Hex Damage activity on the WARLOCK's feature (1d6, by hand) — the rider on the summoned Aberration, Bestial Fury's shape; ⚠ the pack's Thrall Temporary HP formula misspells `@abilitis.cha.mod` (a data defect — the warlock level alone rolls; a Vendor Fixes candidate, not Battle Flow's) |

| **Sculpt Spells** | Wizard — Evoker | ROW | `METAMAGIC` · Careful Spell (the ask at the area, `area-ask.js`) as a FEATURE row (`cap: "1 + @slot"`, no cost) | B4 | an Evocation spell: up to 1 + the slot level creatures picked on the card succeed automatically and take NO damage — Careful's ask with a `none` outcome, no point spent |
