/**
 * Battle Flow — MACHINE (ARCHITECTURE.md §7): the saving throws. ONE machine on ONE `saves` flag,
 * a directory whose only public face is this file. The caster stamps the demand; each target rolls
 * on the client that owns it; the elect folds against the DC STORED AT CAST TIME and applies.
 * The parts' hooks run in dispatch.js's ORDER, not in this list's; cross-part calls are hoisted
 * functions, which is what makes the cycles safe.
 * ⚠ The buzzer ROLLS (a demanded save is mandatory). Legendary resistance arrives as a later
 * UPDATE, and the elect OVERTURNS the verdict. DEAD skips (dead status, NPC at 0 HP) are narrower
 * than hp<=0: a DYING PC is still demanded. A consumed item (a scroll's last use) strands its
 * effects: a late verdict applies damage only. Clock skew moves the buzzer, never the verdict.
